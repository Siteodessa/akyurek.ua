		<fulldesrip><![CDATA[Function:Liquid applicators used for precision coating and pilling of crop with insecticides, fungicides, micronutrients and inoculants to the highest quality standards. Integrated modern control systems provide high process flexibility, process security and process monitoring and documentation. The fully automated operations according to pre-determined formulas, online process data communication, batch and order documentation as well as formula administration guarantee high quality production standards when treating a wide range of products.Working Pricniple:The product is flowing through the inlet buffer by passing the rotary seed valve and wind aspiration into the applicator machine. With spraying disc the product will be distributed in an uniform product veil. The Liquid is feed into the applicators by the pump and the liquid feeding system. The liquid is distributed to the product by the rotating Impeller disc. In the secondary mixing unit the product will be transported and it starts an intensive mixing with the liquid.

 Needle Sorter Performance Operation
The ‘Cylindrical Needle Sorting’ machine is the simplest and most effective system of removing worm-eaten or damaged product from a crop. The entire operation is smooth running, continuous and fully automatic. Most types of peas, beans and other pulses can be sorted by the Cylindrical Needle sorting machine.]]></descripshon>
		<fulldesrip><![CDATA[The machine consists of a revolving cylinder inclined slightly so that the feed end is higher than the delivery end. When the product is fed into the cylinder it moves slowly by gravity along the base towards the delivery end.
The inside of the cylinder is lined with more than 23,500 fine needles. As the cylinder turns, the needles sweep through the product. Any product with weevil holes or cracks are caught by the needles and taken to the top of the cylinder where they are brushed off into a separate collecting trough. When used for pistachio nuts the machine reverses this process and only the open 'good' nuts are caught by the needles. The ‘Cylindrical Needle Sorting’ also eliminates a high proportion of windowed product by piercing the thin week skin, yet leaving sound pulses completely whole and undamaged.
Performance of the ‘Cylindrical Needle Sorting’ is unique
The ‘Cylindrical Needle Sorting’ will run 24 hours a day without supervision. This enables it to handle peak season crops when quick continuous sorting is essential. There is little that can go wrong as all the revolving parts are set in ball races and rubber trunnion wheels reduce noise to a minimum.
The needles are exceptionally hard wearing. They stay sharp and effective for 2-3 years or more depending on the amount of use. A replacement set is easily fitted.
The brushes will seldom need replacing when correctly adjusted to just touch the cylinder side. Maintenance consists of greasing the bearings every 3 to 6 months and topping up the motor with oil. Running costs are very low as a 1 h.p. motor provides all the necessary power.
Specially Built-In Cleaning Screens
Another useful extra feature about the ‘Cylindrical Needle Sorting’ is that two sets of metal cleaning screens are built into the cylinder wall. They are perforated so that dust and foreign particles can sift through as the crop passes over them.]]></fulldesrip>

		<descripshon><![CDATA[Product Code: 
 Akyurek has designed a new gentle-handling elevator combining its existing conveyors’ performance, reliable design and effectiveness.
With a high-performance Akyurek continuous to offer businesses with an economical and sturdy piece of equipment.

 Chain bucket design
 Boot clean doors
 Nuts and Bolted legs
 Seed Contact areas Stainless steel available
 High capacity conveying
 Gear reducer with backstop Shaft-mounted
 Service platforms ladder available
 Valve options-Manual and pneumatic
 Gentle discharge of seed]]></descripshon>
		<fulldesrip><![CDATA[Work principle; seed is transferred into the buckets from intake hopper. The buckets moves up the legs until they are pulled around the first set of gears. The buckets tilted gently and seed dispenses into the discharge hopper. From this hopper the seed feeds through a pipe to your allocated point. The buckets continue in this cycle and provide a continuous, smooth flow of seed with a near zero damage.


Features Options of Easy Dump Elevator

Laser Cut and Bolted Assembly

To reduce the cost of shipment, the legs of our elevators can be shipped disassembled.



Instant Boot cleaning
A draw which is located right at the bottom of the boot makes an easy operation to open the boot and pull out the remaining seed in the elevator in an instant.

'Duck' Series


When with height restrictions and flow pipe limitations are challenge the “Duck” Series Easy Dump Elevator can be used. Feeding and discharging on the same side allows you to achieve spouting configurations that are near impossible by regular elevators.

'Double' Series


For lifting two different products in limited spaces the “Double” Series Easy Dump elevator can be used.
Without contamination you can elevate two different product types. The “Double” to act as two elevators by two separate product in-takes, bucket lanes and discharge spouts.

Easy Operation
Very simple, straightforward and effective work principles.

		<fulldesrip><![CDATA[The P- EL and Z-EL elevator is suited for transportation of cereals, seeds, fertilizers, minerals, wood shavings, wood chips, granular products, and similar materials; also suitable for oleaginous seeds.In standard construction, the EL elevators are delivered with the following features.Standard height is 4.0 m.The elevator belt is oil resistant type 4 Ply 6mm Caoutchouc or Plastic with high number of Plys upon on your plant request.The elevator components are Laser Cut Steel for precise manufacturing.The elevator construction All Through Nut Bolt and Gasket Connected for easy maintenance or future extension.The elevator is All Through Paint : Acrylic Antistatic Owen Powder Painted. Paint Code:9100DISTINGUISHING FEATURES:• Heavy duty steel construction in Acrylic Antistatic Owen Powder Painted finish incorporating belt rolls of hard-wearing material.• Totally enclosed design offering maximum security during operation.• Highly flexible construction to meet a wide range of requirements (height, belt width, belt speed, and belt quality) and to suit individual plant layouts.• Slow speed monitor and reverse brake available as an option.• Large selection of elevator buckets to give the best possible transportation of a vast range of products ensuring correct filling and emptying of the product in question.• Elevator boot with adjustment device for easy belt tensioning ensuring trouble free operationat all times.• Elevator boot with cleanout door on both sides ensuring easy clean-down when changing from one product to another.• Extractable collecting drawer below the elevator or integrated air cleaning system available as an option.• Easy visual check-up during operation through inspection window made of plexiglass.• Manual Product feed control Gate.• Elevators with product intake feed apparatus.• Low maintenance costs and one-year parts warranty.Every part undergoes following processes: sand blasting, spray applicationof primer, phosphate cleaning, 180°C oven baked final paint finish. These processes are applied on a continuous production line. The final result provides optimum resistance to corrosion (&gt;250 hours in salt atmosphere) equivalent to pre-galvanised finish, almost to automobile industry standards. Akyürek makes every effort to be environmentally friendly, controlling all emissions during this process.]]></fulldesrip>
